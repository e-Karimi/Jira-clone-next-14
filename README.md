#### This project acts as a complete full-stack application and management platform designed for the creation and administration of projects and tasks and members related to them. It has been built using a combination of Next.js (version 14), TypeScript, Hono.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn. Appwrite has been chosen as the database. The application was created to improve proficiency in Next.js, focusing on aspects such as dynamic and nested routing, database relationships, and both server and client components. The authentication system has been integrated with appwrite. Several libraries have been utilized, including Hono, date-fns, Zod, React Query, @hello-pangea/dnd, nuqs, and React-Hook-Form, among others.
